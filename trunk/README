INTRODUCTION

Miniweb is a Plasma widget that embeds a WebView (a Webkit-based embeded web
browser widget). It aims to display a compact webpage, mostly web-based apps
like micro-blogging, on your desktop.

Because most web apps are too large in size to fit in this tiny window, Miniweb
supports user agent disguise to make the web-sites think you are using a mobile
device, so that you get the mobile versions of your favourite sites.
